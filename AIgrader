					(0–1	pt)
1	pt.
Responds	to	the	prompt	with	a	historically
defensible	thesis/claim	that	establishes	a
line	of	reasoning.
To	earn	this	point,	the	thesis	must	make	a	claim	that
responds	to	the	prompt,	rather	than	merely	restating	or
rephrasing	the	prompt.	The	thesis	must	consist	of	one	or
more	sentences	located	in	one	place,	either	in	the
introduction	or	the	conclusion.
CONTEXTUALIZATION
					(0–1	pt)
1	pt.
Describes	a	broader	historical	context
relevant	to	the	prompt.
To	earn	this	point,	the	response	must	relate	the	topic	of	the
prompt	to	broader	historical	events,	developments,	or
processes	that	occur	before,	during,	or	continue	after	the
time	frame	of	the	question.	This	point	is	not	awarded	for
merely	a	phrase	or	a	reference.
					EVIDENCE
					(0–2	pts)
1	pt.
Provides	specific	examples	of	evidence
relevant	to	the	topic	of	the	prompt.
OR
2	pts.
Supports	an	argument	in	response	to	the
prompt	using	specific	and	relevant	examples
of	evidence.
To	earn	one	point,	the	response	must	identify	specific
historical	examples	of	evidence	relevant	to	the	topic	of	the
prompt.
To	earn	two	points	the	response	must	use	specific	historical
evidence	to	support	an	argument	in	response	to	the	prompt.
				ANALYSIS
				&
				REASONING
				(0–2	pts)
1	pt.
Uses	historical	reasoning	(e.g.	comparison,
causation,	CCOT)	to	frame	or	structure	an
argument	that	addresses	the	prompt.
OR
2	pts.
Demonstrates	a	complex	understanding	of
the	historical	development	that	is	the	focus
of	the	prompt,	using	evidence	to
corroborate,	qualify, or	modify	an	argument
that	addresses	the	question.
To	earn	the	first	point,	the	response	must	demonstrate	the
use	of	historical	reasoning	to	frame	or	structure	an
argument,	although	the	reasoning	might	be	uneven	or
imbalanced.
To	earn	the	second	point,	the	response	must	demonstrate	a
complex	understanding.	This	can	be	accomplished	in	a
variety	of	ways,	such	as:
• Explaining	nuance	of	an	issue	by	analyzing	multiple
variables
• Explaining	both	similarity	and	difference,	or
explaining	both	continuity	and	change,	or
explaining	multiple	causes,	or	explaining	both
causes	and	effects
• Explaining	relevant	and	insightful	connections
within	and	across	periods
• Confirming	the	validity	of	an	argument	by
corroborating	multiple	perspectives	across	themes
• Qualifying	or	modifying	an	argument	by
considering	diverse	or	alternative	views	or	evidence
This	understanding	must	be	part	of	the	argument,
not	merely	a	phrase	or	reference.""",

Thesis
(0-1 points)
4.B
0 points
For any of the following:
• There is no defensible thesis.
• The intended thesis only restates the prompt.
• The intended thesis provides a summary of the issue with no
apparent or coherent claim.
• There is a thesis, but it does not respond to the prompt.
1 point
Responds to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
• Only restate the prompt.
• Do not take a position, or the position is vague or must
be inferred.
• Equivocate or summarize other’s arguments but not the student’s
(e.g., some people say it’s good, some people say it’s bad).
• State an obvious fact rather than making a claim that requires
a defense.
Responses that earn this point:
• Responds to the prompt rather than restate or rephrase the prompt, and the
thesis clearly takes a position rather than just stating that there are pros/cons.
Additional Notes:
• The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity.
• The thesis may be anywhere within the response.
• For a thesis to be defensible, the sources must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student need
not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point.
• The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point.
• A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.

Summarizes the evidence

the evidence supports the
student’s argument.
2 points
EVIDENCE:
Provides evidence from or
references at least three of

Explains how some of the
evidence relates to the
student’s argument, but
no line of reasoning is
established, or the line of
reasoning is faulty.
3 points

from at least three of
the provided sources to
support all claims in a line of
reasoning.

EVIDENCE:
Provides specific
evidence from at least
three of the provided
sources to support
all claims in a line of

AND
COMMENTARY:
Consistently explains how
the evidence supports a

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Typical responses that
earn 0 points:
• Are incoherent or do not
address the prompt.
• May be just opinion with
no textual references
or references that are
irrelevant.
Typical responses that earn
1 point:
• Tend to focus on summary
or description of sources
rather than specific
details.
Typical responses that earn
2 points:
• Consist of a mix of
specific evidence and
broad generalities.
• May contain some
simplistic, inaccurate, or
repetitive explanations
that don’t strengthen the
argument.
• May make one point well
but either do not make
multiple supporting claims
or do not adequately
support more than one
claim.
• Do not explain the
connections or
progression between the
student’s claims, so a line
of reasoning is not clearly
established.
Typical responses that earn
3 points:
• Uniformly offer evidence
to support claims.
• Focus on the importance
of specific words and
details from the sources
to build an argument.
• Organize an argument
as a line of reasoning
composed of multiple
supporting claims.
• Commentary may fail to
integrate some evidence
or fail to support a key
claim.
Typical responses that
earn 4 points:
• Uniformly offer
evidence to support
claims.
• Focus on the
importance of specific
words and details from
the sources to build an
argument.
• Organize and support
an argument as a line of
reasoning composed
of multiple supporting
claims, each with
adequate evidence that
is clearly explained."""
